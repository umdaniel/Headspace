HeadSpace:

A website used to store a collection of memories and experiences from my life! 

I created this website with the purpose to emulate an application like Instagram or Facebook.

Some Functions:

The user can create memories with an accompanying image, text, and date. These images will be displayed in a grid format for the user to view at anytime.
